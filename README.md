# Neural-Radiance-Field-Ray-Sampling
# This codes takes a json file containing camera extrinsic parameters and creates an extrinsic paramater matrix. It then uses this to shoot rays from the origin and into the scene through each pixel. Finally, 3D points are sampled along the rays via uniform and stratified sampling.
