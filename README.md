# Neural-Radiance-Field-Ray-Sampling
# This is a series of low-level functions that can be used to sample points which can then be fed into a neural network (e.g. neural radiance field). It uses an extrinsic parameter matrix to shoot rays from the origin and into the scene through each pixel before 3D points are sampled along the rays via stratified sampling. Distortion correction and positional encoding is included.
